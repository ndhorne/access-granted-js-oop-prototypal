Access Granted JS Prototypal

A diversion brought to you by Nicholas D. Horne

Crack a PIN knowing the digits that the PIN comprises

Can you actually crack a four-digit PIN on your
first attempt as seen in the movies on a telltale
worn keypad? The "worn" keys contained in the
PIN have been highlighted on the keypad. PINs
are four digits in length. Digits may be repeated
resulting in PINs with less than four keys being
highlighted. PINs may begin with zero. Input is
accepted by way of both mouse primary button
and keyboard number keys.

This new but not necessarily improved implementation
of Access Granted JS utilizes "constructor" functions
and prototypal "inheritance" to logically encapsulate
related data and behavior together inside of a single
self-contained unit more commonly known as an instance
in a bid to manage complexity through the constructs
afforded by object oriented programming.
